Bank Transfer: This is one of our most popular funding methods. You can find out about domestic and international deposits, as well as bank transfer options. Simply navigate to the deposit section, where you will find all available deposit methods. The minimum available deposit on your account will be displayed by default so that you won't be able to use the decrease button below that amount and the maximum displayed deposit amount.

What happens when you use the funding methods link is that the minimum and maximum deposit limits are displayed.

Once you have selected your payment method, the next screen will pop up in close when account funding is successful and the transaction is completed with an instant deposit.

The deposit amount for each time that you must make at least USD 5. If you're depositing to your account for the first time, it is going to open the amount that each you have defined as the default per the account type.

In your trading account, there will be a deposit notification for as long as a deposit is pending.

Whatever method you use to deposit, keep in mind that funds must always originate from your account, and deposits cannot receive any third-party or anonymous deposit due to international Anti money laundering laws.

We offer several methods for making deposits to your trading account. We recommend selecting the payment methods are described.`
